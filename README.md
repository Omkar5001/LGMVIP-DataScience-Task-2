Task 2 - Stock Market Prediction and Forecasting using LSTM

We are given TATAGLOBAL stock price from 21 July 2010 to 28 September 2018. The task is to predict the trend of the stock price for the year 2017. Note that, based on National Stock Exchange (NSE), the future variations of stock price are independent of the past. So, it is impossible to predict the exact stock price, but possible to predict and capture the upward and downward trends.
